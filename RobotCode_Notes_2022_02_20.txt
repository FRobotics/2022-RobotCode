2/20/2022   JAS  Robot Code Notes.

General
	-- implement a trajectory following VI similar to DriveForwardDistance.

Team Code
	Teleop
	-- DONT USE GLOBAL VARIABLES in this VI.  Call your "setter" VIs !!!!
	-- Turn the driving Case decider if statements into a separate VI.  
		Will make code cleaner.
	-- Extract all the Button, Axes, and POV values outside the case statement.
		Allows easier univeral use..


DriveSystem
	-- All VI in the Drive system should have "Drive" in their name!
		If not specifically for drive system, move to general purpose
		directory.

	Drive_Get_Speed
	-- Add a routine to get gyro reading, or add gyro output here.
	-- Add a routine to get lidar distance, or add lidar output here.
	-- Add a routine to get encoder distance, or add distance output here.

	
	DriveForwardDistance
	-- Use setter and getter VI instead of global variables...
	-- Implement calculation for Threshold Error input (Currently hardcoded
		at 7.0) as a function of max speed so routine behaves the same
		regardless what the users passes as max speed.  In other words
		keep the "slope" of the slow down function the same and start
		the slow down at a different threshold error value depending
		on what max speed the user passes...
	

	ExecuteSpeed
	-- If there is time, the PID could be tuned a little.
		Ki can probably be larger..  (maybe between 1 and 2)
	-- Check robot mode.  If disabled, use zero as the speed demand and
		write this to global variable.  A small non-zero speed demand
		when the motors are forced to zero will cause the I part of the
		PID to wind up.  This causes the "jump" when enabling.
	-- Add a global variable to indicate Auto(closed loop)/Manual(open loop).  
		Use this to switch.  Initialize to auto.  Write state to network 
		tables.

	GetDrive
	-- Calibrate Lidar
	-- Rename Encoder Ref to indicate left and right.   They are currently 
		Encoder 1 and Encoder 2...  Need to change this everywhere.
		
	JoyToFPS
	-- Rename to indicate part of drive system.

	OpenDrive
	-- rename drive encoders so everyone knows which is right and left.

	SetDistanceFromWall

	-- Use setter and getter VI instead of global variables...
	-- Implement calculation for Threshold Error input (Currently hardcoded
		at 7.0) as a function of max speed so routine behaves the same
		regardless what the users passes as max speed.  In other words
		keep the "slope" of the slow down function the same and start
		the slow down at a different threshold error value depending
		on what max speed the user passes...
	
	
	TurnDistance.

	-- Use setter and getter VI instead of global variables...
	-- Implement calculation for Threshold Error input (Currently hardcoded
		at 45) as a function of max speed so routine behaves the same
		regardless what the users passes as max speed.  In other words
		keep the "slope" of the slow down function the same and start
		the slow down at a different threshold error value depending
		on what max speed the user passes...  (It doesn't matter that
		the error is degrees and speed is ft/sec...slope is still slope.)
	
General Purpose
	ButtonCycle
	
	
Human
	
	GetHumanInput
	-- could read all the joysticks at once... (and only once per cycle)
	-- could move network tables write to "human network" (add globals for 
		joystick values)

	

Autonomous
	
	DropIntake
	-- use setter VI not global variable.

	SpinAuxsAuto
	-- maybe make this more sequenced 

Auxiliary

	GetAux
	-- add filtering after shooter speed calculation


	OpenAux
	*** There is only one DOUBLE solenoid for intake, not two SINGLE solenoids...
