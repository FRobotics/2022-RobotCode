Team Code



	Teleop
	-- Label what each driving case is for!!!
	-- DONT USE GLOBAL VARIABLES in this VI.  Call your "setter" VIs !!!!
	-- Turn the driving Case decider if statements into a separate VI.  
		Will make code cleaner.
	-- Wire neatness -- especially when crossing into or out of case stmt.
	-- Extract all the Button, Axes, and POV values outside the case statement.
		Allows easier univeral use..
	-- What is "ShootButton", "RevButton", and "ClimbButton" global variables.
		Process all the buttons IN THIS ROUTINE and pass their values via
		setter functions to other routines if needed.
	-- Use Integers, not floats, for case indexes.  (Right click and select
		"representatio" to change constant data type.)

DriveSystem
	
	Drive_Get_Speed
	-- Add a routine to get gyro reading, or add gyro output here.
	-- Add a routine to get lidar distance, or add lidar output here.
	-- Add a routine to get encoder distance, or add distance output here.

	DriveForwardDistance
	-- Use setter and getter VI instead of global variables...
	-- Implement calculation for Threshold Error input (Currently hardcoded
		at 7.0) as a function of max speed so routine behaves the same
		regardless what the users passes as max speed.  In other words
		keep the "slope" of the slow down function the same and start
		the slow down at a different threshold error value depending
		on what max speed the user passes...
	-- Now that encoder speed and PID work, do you want the min speed to be
		2 FT/SEC ??

	ExecuteSpeed
	-- If there is time, the PID could be tuned a little.
		Ki can probably be larger..  (maybe between 1 and 2)
	-- Check robot mode.  If disabled, use zero as the speed demand and
		write this to global variable.  A small non-zero speed demand
		when the motors are forced to zero will cause the I part of the
		PID to wind up.  This causes the "jump" when enabling.
