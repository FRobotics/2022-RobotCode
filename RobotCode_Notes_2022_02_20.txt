Team Code
	Teleop
	-- DONT USE GLOBAL VARIABLES in this VI.  Call your "setter" VIs !!!!
	-- Turn the driving Case decider if statements into a separate VI.  
		Will make code cleaner.
	-- Extract all the Button, Axes, and POV values outside the case statement.
		Allows easier univeral use..
	-- What is "ShootButton", "RevButton", and "ClimbButton" global variables.
		Process all the buttons IN THIS ROUTINE and pass their values via
		setter functions to other routines if needed.

DriveSystem
	Drive_Get_Speed
	-- Add a routine to get gyro reading, or add gyro output here.
	-- Add a routine to get lidar distance, or add lidar output here.
	-- Add a routine to get encoder distance, or add distance output here.

	DriveForwardDistance
	-- Use setter and getter VI instead of global variables...
	-- Implement calculation for Threshold Error input (Currently hardcoded
		at 7.0) as a function of max speed so routine behaves the same
		regardless what the users passes as max speed.  In other words
		keep the "slope" of the slow down function the same and start
		the slow down at a different threshold error value depending
		on what max speed the user passes...
